## About me

I am a third year Computer Science student at the Univesity of Lincoln. I am passionate about writing clean, fast C++ code and algorithms/logic procedures. 

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing games (video or tabletop, I'm happy either way) with my friends, cooking and trying new foods, and teaching myself new skills such as guitar and juggling. 

I am currently looking for employment in a C++ development role for after I graduate in 2021.
